Day planner: time slots that dynamically update formatting based on time of day. Add tasks to a time slot and save to local storage, when the page is refreshed they persist.

// ---> TO DO: fix text box focus bug, can update event once the event is saved to storage because of loop
// ---> TO DO: check that text box formatting updates on the hour

// ---> EXTRAS TO DO:
//      -> break up the task row into blocks depending on how many tasks are in that time slot
//      -> make functionality to mark a task complete and move it to a completed tasks list
//      -> set up the header like my current homepage
